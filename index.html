<p>Interactions, Domains, Experiments and Annotations browser</p>

<p>The purpose of the software is to allow a complex network of relationships to be searched for 'neighborhoods of interest', and then for data about these neighborhoods to be visualised.</p>

<p>This software implements a website to allow search and navigation of a graph of connections between items. The graph of network relationships can be submitted to the browser in a file, stored in a MySQL database, or retrieved from a webservice (BioGrid is currently implemented), or any of all of the above.</p>

<p>When a query for nodes of interest is submitted to the website, the above sources are searched for network neighbours of the nodes of interest.  The resulting subgraph is then visualised as a network of related nodes.</p>

<p>On clicking on one or more nodes, plots of case-control or timeseries data associated with selected nodes, with or without replicates, can be visualised as barcharts, timeseries or heatmaps.</p>

<p>The software was created to allow for search among relationships between genes, and to visualise gene expresion data, but is very flexible and can be used in any context where a set of related nodes is available, and a set of information about each node.</p>

<p>The software depends on a webserver which supports PHP.</p>
